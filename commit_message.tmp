feat: Refactor app structure and embedding providers

This commit introduces a major refactoring to streamline the application's structure and externalize the embedding model.

Key changes:

1.  **Consolidate App Entry Points**:
    *   Removed redundant app files (`app.py`, `enhanced_app.py`, `quick_start.py`, `ultra_fast_start.py`).
    *   `main_app.py` is now the single, unified entry point.
    *   Introduced `APP_MODE` in the configuration to switch between a full UI and a quick-start mode.

2.  **Externalize Embedding Model to Jina API**:
    *   Removed the self-hosted `sentence-transformers` model to significantly reduce Docker image size and build time.
    *   Integrated Jina AI as the sole embedding provider.
    *   Added `JINA_API_KEY` to the configuration.

3.  **Refactor RAG System Initialization**:
    *   Created a factory function `get_rag_system()` in `utils.py` to select the RAG system (`enhanced`, `graph`, `elasticsearch`) based on `RAG_SYSTEM_TYPE` in the config.
    *   Simplified the initialization logic in `main_app.py`.

4.  **Fix and Clean Up**:
    *   Cleaned up `requirements.txt` by removing unused and commented-out packages.
    *   Updated `.env.example` and `CLAUDE.md` to reflect the new configuration.
    *   Added `.claude/` to `.gitignore`.
